# AirBnB Clone

## Description
- This is a clone of the real AirBnb web application. It is a test of my learning so far, especially concepts like Object-Oriented Programming.
- There are components that I will create which will make this project successful. These will include:
  - `A console` - Here I will play around with the classes and how things will be stored and deleted and updated and so on.
  - The different classes - These are objects that will be used to create for xample the place, the type of house and so on.
  - `unittests` - These will ensure everything is working as it should.
